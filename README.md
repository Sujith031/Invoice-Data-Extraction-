## Description
The Invoice Data Extraction project is designed to automate the extraction of essential information from PDF invoices using Python. It utilizes the `pdf2image` library for PDF-to-image conversion, `google.generativeai` for language-based extraction, and the `Levenshtein` library for string similarity matching, ensuring accurate data retrieval even with slight variations in invoice formats. The extracted data can be organized into structured formats for easy further processing.
